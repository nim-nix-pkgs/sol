# Sol
## 0.4.0

Sol exposes fully portable vector operations for C and Nim that use SIMD when
possible, but use scalar operations otherwise.

### Examples

First, a simple example in C:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sol/sol.h>

int main() {
  f32x2 v = f32x2_set(0, 1);      // Initialize a vector at x = 0, y = 1.
  v = f32x2_rot(v, f32_pi);       // Rotate by pi radians counterclockwise. (180 degrees.)
  printf("%f, %f\n", x(v), y(v)); // Prints 0, -1.
  x(v) = 5;                       // Setting can also be done via the scalar accessor; it is a macro, not a function.
  printf("%f, %f\n", x(v), y(v)); // Prints 5, -1.
  return 0;
}
```

And the same thing in Nim:

```Nim
import sol

var v: float32x2 = f32x2(0, 1) # Here more idiomatic names like "float32x2" are used for types. "f32x2" is analogous to "f32x2_set".
v = v.rot(f32_pi)              # Functions are overloaded instead of having the type name in them, for brevity.
echo v                         # Stringify is overloaded for the vector types; no need to format.
v.x = 5
echo v
```

### Documentation

#### Types

##### Scalars

C Sol exposes the scalar types `f32`, `f64`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `u8`,
`u16`, `u32`, and `u64`. The reason for these new names is because ARM NEON
SIMD intrinsics already used the names `float32x2_t` and such, and I didn't want
the name to be similar to those.

In Nim, the existing scalar types are used-- `float32`, `float64`, `int8`,
`int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, and `uint64`.

##### Vectors

All of the vector types in C are broken down into the name format `TxW`, where
`T` is the scalar type being vectored and `W` is the width of the vector. For
instance, `f64x3` is a `3`-wide vector of `f64`s. As it stands, 2- 3- and
4-wide vectors exist for each scalar type.

Nim is the same, but with the corresponding scalar names; for example, `f64x3`
is instead `float64x3`.

#### Functions & Constants

##### Scalars

The C scalar function names are of the form `T_f`, where `T` is the scalar type
you are working with and `f` is the name of the function. For example, `f32_cos`
is `cos` for `f32`.

| T T_abs_neg(T f)       | The same as `-T_abs(f)`, except faster.                                                     |

| T T_mod(T x, T y)      | Find `x` modulo `y`.                                                                        |
| T T_sin(T f)           | Find the sine of `f`. Calculated using `T_cos(T_pi_2 - f)`.                                 |
| T T_cos(T f)           | Find the cosine of `f`. Calculated [like so](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ellzidi5cv). |

| T T_asin(T f)          | Find the arcsine of `f`. Calls out to libm.                                                 |
| T T_acos(T f)          | Find the arccosine of `f`. Calls out to libm.                                               |

The scalar constants and functions in Nim retain the same prefixes, `f32` and
the like. I *would* overload them, but the names already exist with the same
type signature in Nim's math library, so it seems like more headache to try to
be clean with naming here.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| TxW TxW_set(...)          | Takes `W` arguments of type `T` to construct a vector. |
| TxW TxW_setf(T f)         | Fill all `W` lanes with `f` to construct a vector.     |
| TxW TxW_add(TxW a, TxW b) | Does a lane-wise addition of `a` and `b`.              |
| TxW TxW_addf(TxW v, T f)  | Shorthand for `TxW_add(v, TxW_setf(f)`.                |
| TxW TxW_sub(TxW a, TxW b) | Subtract each lane of `b` from the same lane of `a`.   |
| TxW TxW_subf(TxW v, T f)  | Shorthand for `TxW_sub(v, TxW_setf(f))`.               |
| TxW TxW_fsub(T f, TxW v)  | Shorthand for `TxW_sub(TxW_setf(f), v)`.               |
| TxW TxW_mul(TxW a, TxW b) | Does a lane-wise multiplication of `a` and `b`.        |
| TxW TxW_mulf(TxW v, T f)  | Shorthand for `TxW_mul(v, TxW_setf(f))`.               |
| TxW TxW_div(TxW a, TxW b) | Divide each lane in `a` by the same lane of `b`.       |
| TxW TxW_divf(TxW v, T f)  | Shorthand for `TxW_div(v, TxW_setf(f))`.               |
| TxW TxW_fdiv(T f, TxW v)  | Shorthand for `TxW_div(TxW_setf(f), v)`.               |
| T TxW_sum(TxW v)          | Find the sum of all lanes in `v`.                      |
| TxW TxW_sq(TxW v)         | Square each lane in `v`.                               |

The nim names are a bit different:

- `TxW_set` is now written just `TxW`, where `T` is named as if it were in C. `f32x2_set` becomes `f32x2`, for instance.
- `TxW_setf` is not available in Nim.
- `TxW_add`, `TxW_addf`, `TxW_sub`, `TxW_subf`, `TxW_fsub`, `TxW_mul`, `TxW_mulf`, `TxW_div`, `TxW_divf`, and `TxW_fdiv` are all just their symbolic operators now. `f32x2_add(a, b)` becomes `a + b`, for instance. As operators, `mulf` and `addf` may also be called "backwards" now, like `2 * v`.
- `TxW_sum` and `TxW_sq` drop their prefix and are simply overloaded. For instance, `f32x2_sum(f32x2_set(1, 0))` is instead `sum(f32x2(1, 0))` or `f32x2(1, 0).sum`.
- Simple `op=` operators are supported, so you may do `+=` and the like.
- All vectors have `$` defined, so they may be converted to a string.
- Vector lane set is now written `v.x = 5` rather `x(v) = 5`.
- Thanks to Nim UFCS, vector lane get can be written `v.x` now rather than `x(v)`-- but you can do either.
